.TP
.BI "essid = " <ESSID_of_network>
This value can be found using iwconfig(8).
.TP
.BI "hidden = " <True|False>
This option notes whether the network's ESSID is broadcast or not.
.TP
.BI "channel = " <integer_value>

.TP
.BI "key = " <plain_text_key>
Be sure this file is readable only by root.
.TP
.BI "automatic = " <True|False>
This option determines whether Wicd should automatically connect to this 
network.
.TP
.BI "ip = " <None|ip_address>
Use this option if you have a static ip address for your system.
.TP
.BI "netmask = " <None|network mask>
This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is configured above.
.TP
.BI "broadcast = " <None|broadcast_address>
This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is configured above.
.TP
.BI "gateway = " <None|gateway_address>
This setting is only appropriate if a static ip address is configured above.
.TP
.BI "use_static_dns = " <True|False>
True = use static DNS servers instead of accepting what the dhcp server supplies.
.TP
.BI "use_global_dns = " <True|False>
True = use the global DNS servers provided in wicd-manager-settings.conf(5).
.br
This option is only appropriate if "use_static_dns = True"
.TP
.BI "dns1 = " <None|ip_address>
Static DNS address if "use_static_dns = True" and "use_global_dns = False"
.TP
.BI "dns2 = " <None|ip_address>
Static DNS address if "use_static_dns = True" and "use_global_dns = False"
.TP
.BI "dns3 = " <None|ip_address>
Static DNS address if "use_static_dns = True" and "use_global_dns = False"
.TP
.BI "use_settings_globally = " <0|1>
Wicd keeps track of whether to autoconnect to networks based on bssid.
This ensures that you don't accidentally connect to another network that is
not yours but happens to have the same essid - for example, there are a lot
of commercial routers in use with "linksys" as the essid.
.br
0 = Do not use settings globally
.br
1 = Use settings globally
.TP
.BI "beforescript = " <None|arbitrary_script>
This defines a script to run before Wicd brings up the connection.
.br
IMPORTANT - scripts should ONLY be writable by root and should be located 
in a directory that is writable by only root.
.TP
.BI "afterscript = " <None|arbitrary_script>
This defines a script to run after Wicd brings up the connection.
.br
IMPORTANT - scripts should ONLY be writable by root and located 
in a directory that is writable by only root.
.TP
.BI "predisconnectscript = " <None|arbitrary_script>
This defines a script to run before Wicd disconnects the interface.
.TP
.BI "postdisconnectscript = " <None|arbitrary_script>

.SH OTHER
The "use_settings_globally" option determines how an individual network's
configuration stanza starts.  If the option is "0" (do not use settings
globally), then the stanza's top line will be the bssid of the access
point (in this format):  
.br
[00:15:3E:87:D3:68]
.br
If the "option is set to "1" (use settings globally), then the first line
of the stanza will be in this format: 
.br
[essid:UA Public Wireless Network]
