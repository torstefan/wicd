WHERE ARE MY FILES?!

If you are reading this in %VARLIB%, then you may ignore (but please don't
delete) this file.  The only reason it is here is that it is definitely
constant between package updates.

If you are reading this from your home directory, you are probably wondering
why your Wicd configuration files are not in ~/.wicd.  What follows is a
summary of the folders that Wicd uses.

For a more detailed (and complete) description what is in each directory,
consult the man pages for wicd(8) and wicd-curses(8).

~/.wicd
    User-dependent configuration files

%ETC%
    Global configuration files

%NETWORKS%
    Individual network configurations
