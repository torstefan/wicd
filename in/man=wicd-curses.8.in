.SH NAME
.B wicd-curses
\- curses-based wicd(8) controller
.SH DESCRIPTION
wicd-curses is a curses-based network controller that uses the Wired/Wireless Internet Connection Daemon (wicd) to control your network connections. It is suitable to run in terminal multiplexers like screen(1).

It is designed to imitate the GTK-based wicd-client(1) as much as possible, and uses the Urwid (http://excess.org/urwid) console widget library to vastly simplify development.

This man page only documents the current status of wicd-curses.  This may/may not be the most up-to-date document.

.\"Bring up the script selector for the selected network (requires superuser privileges)
Bring up instructions on how to edit the scripts.  I have implemented a way to do this in the interface itself, but making it function with all Linux distros would be difficult.  Since you are reading this, you should know how to do what I suggest.  ;-)
