  [ David Paleino ]

  * debian/default added.
  * debian/init updated:

  [ Bernd Zeimetz ]
  * debian/rules:
    - run dh_pysupport before dh_installinit, so Python modules will be
      compiled before the daemon starts (Closes: #510457)
    - call setup.py configure and install with appropriate options, so the
      modules are installed in the private module directory properly
      (Closes: #510462).
  * debian/patches/04-fix-scripts.patch:
    - set PYTHONPATH while executing script so Python will find them
      in the private directory (Closes: #510308)
