Description: wired and wireless network manager - metapackage
 Wicd is a general-purpose network configuration server which aims
 to provide a simple but flexible interface for connecting to networks.
 Its features include:
  * wide variety of settings;
  * ability to connect to (and maintain profiles for) both wired and
    wireless networks;
  * support for many encryption schemes, including WEP, WPA, WPA2 and
    custom schemes;
  * wireless-tools compatibility;
  * tray icon showing network activity and signal strength;
  * lack of GNOME dependencies (although it does require GTK+), making it
    easy to use in Xfce, Fluxbox, Openbox, Enlightenment, etc.
 .
 This is a metapackage, it allows installation of all the components of
 Wicd, including one of the clients, which must be manually chosen.
