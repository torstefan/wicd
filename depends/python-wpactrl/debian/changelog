python-wpactrl (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major version 1.0.0, first release to the wild.
  * Add/enhance doc strings for extension and all methods.
  * Just return None for attach() and detach() methods, they can only fail
    and raise error or succeed.
  * Add Vcs fields to debian/control.
  * Do not hardcode a python version in Makefile.
  * Add DESTDIR support to Makefile.
  * Use upstream Makefile in debian/rules instead of calling setup.py
    directly.
  * Fix lintian error in package debian/control long description by
    capitalizing Python.
  * Add entry for wpactrl.c in debian/copyright, adding original Authour's
    name and copyright statement.
  * Add a .PHONY entry to Makefile, so that 'build' can be called more than
    once, for eg., multiple python versions.
  * Add README file including description and installation blurbs.
  * Add copyright/license information to example.py.
  * Enhance the use of the attached WPACtrl struct member, explicitly checking
    and setting its value.
  * Don't allow an WPACtrl instance to attach() more than once, similarly only
    allow the detach() method to do something if the instance previously
    attach()'d.
  * Remove the isattached() WPACtrl instance method.
  * Remove embedded code example from wpactrl doc string.
  * Expose the attached WPACtrl struct member as an instance data attribute.

python-wpactrl (0.10.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add attached to wpactrl struct, to act as boolean when object as
    registered as event monitor.
  * Add attached() object method to return pythonic boolean based on state of
    attached wpactrl struct member.
  * Reorder the object method heirachy to match that of wpa_ctrl.h more
    closely.
  * Remove check for self->ctrl_iface in each object method, that condition
    cannot be possible since object will raise an exception of
    self->ctrl_iface could not be created at init.
  * Adhere to the CapWords convention for the class name, renaming wpactrl
    class to WPACtrl.

python-wpactrl (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename wpactrl_dealloc() object method to wpactrl_close().
  * Add wpactrl_attach() and wpactrl_detach() object methods.

 -- Kel Modderman <kel@otaku42.de>  Mon, 21 Apr 2008 03:47:14 +1000

python-wpactrl (0.9.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't open two sockets for 2-way communication, one socket returned by
    wpa_ctrl_open() is sufficient for sending and receiving.
  * Don't include (and allocate memory for) the sendbuf and recvbuf wpactrl
    struct members.
  * Fix check of path string length, to make sure we are able to allocate
    enough memory to accommodate it.
  * Don't rely on python's PyArg_ParseTuple() to return length of argument in
    wpactrl_request() method, just use strlen instead.
  * Rename socket object member to ctrl_iface_path.
  * Rename close() object method to detach().
  * If wpactrl_reattach() method fails, allow exception to be raised rather
    than returning false.
  * Rename wpactrl_init() object method to wpactrl_open().

python-wpactrl (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop recevents method and helper function.
  * Overhaul wpactrl_init, doing paranoid chanking that every allocation of
    memory and so on is completed.
  * free() send and recv buffers in wpactrl_close() to ensure we do not leak
    memory should we choose to reattach().

python-wpactrl (0.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * More code cleanups, rename wpactrlError to wpactrl_error for consistency.
  * Shorten the version defines.
  * Add wpactrl_members structure to provide access to path attribute of
    wpactrl instances.
  * Rename the path attribute to socket. Remove socket wpactrl method.
  * Check if bss command returned a string starting with bssid rather than
    testing string length, it could return UNKNOWN COMMAND or FAILED.
  * Rename events method to recvevents, to be more descriptive about expected
    action.
  * Numerous trivial code beautifications.
  * Bugfix output of example.py.
  * Include a changelog in the tarball generated by "upstream-release".
  * Check pathsize is less than allocated size.

python-wpactrl (0.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add -fno-strict-aliasing to compiler flags to silence noise with
    python2.5.
  * Global rename of 'buff' to 'buf'.
  * Add Reattach() method, to reattach monitor to a wpa_ctrl path that was
    previously attached by recycling the WPACtrl_init() function.
  * Take better care of handling all possible return values for the
    wpa_ctrl_*() functions.
  * Recycle WPACtrl_Recv() when collecting a list of events for the
    RecvPendingEvents() method.
  * Readd the Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS keywords around
    the wpa_ctrl_recv() in Recv() method, as the forked upstream seemed to
    support threading at that point.
  * Update example.py to show commands as they are executed, similar in
    appearance to IDLE.

python-wpactrl (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure send or recv socket is open before attempting to access it via one
    of the WPACtrl object methods.
  * Take care that the Recv() method is not blocking, return None if
    wpa_ctrl_pending indicates we have nothing pending.

  * Remove ./build directory in debian/rules clean: target.
  * Don't mark functions explicitly as inline, let the compiler make those
    decisions.
  * Enhance example.py to show of a few of wpactrl's methods, and to not
    hardcode interface name for easier testing.
