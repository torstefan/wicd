python-wpactrl
--------------
A Python extension for wpa_supplicant/hostapd control interface access

Description
-----------
wpactrl defines a single class, WPACtrl, that must be instantiated
with the pathname of a UNIX domain socket control interface of a
wpa_supplicant/hostapd daemon.

Once a WPACtrl object has been instantiated, it may call several
helper methods to interact with the wpa_supplicant/hostapd daemon.
If an error occurs, a wpactrl.error exception is raised.

The destructor of a WPACtrl instance closes the connection to the
control interface socket.

Recommendations for the use of wpa_supplicant/hostapd control
interface access in external programs are at:
    <http://w1.fi/wpa_supplicant/devel/ctrl_iface_page.html>

Installation
------------
make
make install

Two Makefile variables may be specified on the command line; PYTHON and
DESTDIR.

PYTHON  - Python executable that should be called (eg. python2.5)
DESTDIR - Alternative root destination directory
