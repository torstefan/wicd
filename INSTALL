Installation of Wicd should be done using your distribution package if one
exists.  If not, the installation is relatively straightforward.

If you are installing from a subversion pull or beta/rc tarball and you want 
the native language translations, first run this:
  python setup.py get_translations
You will not need to do this if you're installing from a release tarball.

Next, configure Wicd for installation.  Wicd will, by default, follow the 
FHS guidelines <http://www.pathname.com/fhs/> (or distribution standards 
where applicable if we know about them and it's feasible to implement them).
You can specify exactly where every non-Python file (and some Python files) 
in Wicd will be placed.  Pass "--help" as an option to the following command
for more information, otherwise run it as is to configure Wicd for installation.
  python setup.py configure

Finally, do the actual installation.  This step will need to be done as
root or with sudo in most cases:
  python setup.py install
If you are packaging Wicd, you will almost surely want to use the "--root"
option; for example:
  python setup.py install --root=/package-dir

To uninstall, you can use (using root or sudo):
  python setup.py uninstall

You *MUST* run "python setup.py configure" before "python setup.py install" -
the "configure" step generates wpath.py from wpath.py.in using the paths 
specified from the arguments to "python setup.py configure". 
As noted above in the configure step, "python setup.py configure" will use 
acceptable defaults, so it is usually not necessary to specify any arguments 
at all.

After installation, especially if Wicd has not been installed before, you 
will probably need to restart the system message bus (dbus) or reload its 
configuration.  You will also need to make sure the Wicd init script is
started at boot.  How to do those things is distribution-dependent, so if 
you're not sure, ask in your distribution's support area(s).
