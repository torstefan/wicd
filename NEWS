Wicd 1.6.0 Branch
1.7.0:
	Changes for Packagers:
	- Wicd now supports a -k option, which should be run by the init script
	  when the daemon is stopped to release the DHCP lease but should not
	  be run on a restart of the daemon.
	- The ability has been added to split Wicd's components into multiple
	  directories. Use --gtk, --cli, --curses, and --daemon to
	  setup.py configure to specify the locations of the respective
	  components.
	- The preferred way to run the GTK UI is now to use wicd-gtk, not
	  wicd-client. wicd-gtk is a new addition to 1.7 that will never
	  run wicd-curses. wicd-client will automatically decide to run
	  wicd-curses if there is no X session available.

	Major Changes:
	- Connection information is available by right clicking the tray icon
	- Can set the hostname per network for all DHCP clients
	- urwid 0.9.9 is now supported
	- Added wicd-cli, a command line interface for use in scripts
	- Global scripts are now passed parameters specifying the network

	Minor Changes:
	- Support for only displaying notifications using -o to wicd-client
	- Reconnecting now works when measuring signal strength in dBm
	- ESSIDs made of numbers now work properly
	- All valid wpa_supplicant drivers are now displayed
	- Wired network is now displayed while scanning wireless networks
	- Added wicd-gtk, a command to always and only run the GTK UI
	- Marked ioctl backend not supported
	- Use dhcpcd-bin on Debian instead of dhcpcd script

1.6.2:
	Minor Changes:
	- Now deals better if the interface disappears while running
	- Will now start if the global script directories don't exist
	- Adhoc window will now work correctly
	- PSK can be generated from non-ASCII characters
	- Fix a minor wicd-curses crash while connecting during a scan

1.6.1:
	Minor Changes:
	- User is told if the lack permission to access the daemon
	- Support for wireless cards that don't report signal strength added
	- Enhanced network configuration dialog title

1.6.0:
	Major Changes:
	- Improved tray icon and GUI images (thanks to Martin Sagastume)
	- Reorganized network list in the GUI for easier navigation
	- New experimental ioctl backend, which is more cpu-friendly than the 
	  previous one 
	- Added a curses client (thanks to Andrew Psaltis)
	- Added a right-click connection menu to the tray icon
	- Added options to specify a DNS domain and search domain for static networks
	- Reworked the Preferences menu to be more in line with GNOME standards
	- Added support for global scripts
	- Made it possible to have optional entries in encryption templates
	- Added ability to show libnotify notifications on status change

	Minor Changes and Other Enhancements:
	- Better autoconnection behavior
	- Tray/GUI will survive the daemon being killed
	- Reasons for connection failures will now bubble back to the GUI
	- Add/remove wired profile system is now more user-friendly
	- Support for using resolvconf instead of directly editing /etc/resolv.conf
	- Wicd won't blindly kill dhcp clients / wpa_supplicant any more
	- Added an option to automatically switch from a wireless network to a wired 
	  one as soon as a cable is plugged in
	- Moved scanning to its own thread, which makes GUI and daemon more responsive
	  during scans
	- Made it possible to specify macros in script entries
	- The GUI will now display the encryption entry dialog if you attempt to 
	  connect to an encrypted network without entering a password
	- Static gateway entry is now optional
	- Passwords with leading or trailing whitespace are now stored properly
	- Many init/config script, man page, and setup.py fixes/updates, including
	  better autodetection of file placement with regard to sleep hooks and 
	  KDE autostart files (thanks to Robby Workman)
